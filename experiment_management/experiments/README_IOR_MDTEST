Background:
IOR and mdtest previously relied on a wrapper script that was responsible for
running IOR and mdtest within experiment management.  This wrapper was needed
because it executed an external script that gathhered information about
the environment and panfs.  It's primary function was to parse the test output 
stream and create a MySQl insert command with all resultant fields.   

Testing using this method was limited and file management became a problem.
For this reason, we have come up with a new method for gathering output and
placing it into our MySQL database.

New Test Method:
The new method uses a python script to parse the output from the 
run_expr.py generated output file (post processed). These files are located in the 
experiments directory and are named:

mdtest_out_to_db.py
ior_out_to_db.py

They can be executed as follows:

./mdtest_out_to_db.py --file test_output_file --db_file_path path 
./ior_out_to_db.py --file test_output_file --db_file_path path 

The arguments to both scripts are identical and specify the output_file 
to parse and the path to the location of the sql file that will contain
database insert commands.  The db file can then be sourced
within our database: mpi_io_test_pro on phpmyadmin.lanl.gov 

This experiments directory also has a bash shell script (process_output.sh) 
that looks for the most recent output files and runs the appropiate parse script 
mentioned above.  The script determines if the output file contains IOR
output or mdtest output.  This works nicely with the run_expr.py --post 
argument which allows for running a script when a specific run is complete.  
In other words the database file is being updated as the tests 
are running (if you have a series of dependent jobs queued).

IOR example running post script to create db files:

./run_expr.py -w 1800 -d msub -M '-j oe -V' --post=/turquoise/users/atorrez/working-wrappers/fs_test/experiment_management/experiments/process_output.sh -c experiments/ior_rrz_nn.py


MDTEST  example running post script to create db files:

./run_expr.py -w 1800 -d msub -M '-j oe -V' --post=/turquoise/users/atorrez/working-wrappers/fs_test/experiment_management/experiments/process_output.sh -c experiments/mdtest_rrz.py

Notes:

1)  When using run_expr with the --post option, the full path to the script must be specified.

2)  process_output.sh contains three path variables that must be edited.
    a) expr_mgmt_top - path to top level experiment_managment directory 
        e.g.  /users/atorrez/Testing/fs_test/experiment_management
    b) ior_db_path - path to ior sql file 
        e.g. /users/atorrez/sql_files/ior
        ior.sql_query file will be created/appended in this directory
        this file is then sourced in MySQL
    c) mdtest_db_path - path to mdtest sql file
        e.g. /users/atorrez/sql_files/mdtest
        mdtest.sql_query file will be created/appended in this directory
        this file is then sourced in MySQL
